# **Personal/HS Projects** ‚å®Ô∏è

There's so much to talk about! Let's dive right in... üòé

> Projects conducted with Cisco Research will be added in soon as a separate page! 

## **Developing Reinforcement-Learning Traffic Control** üö¶

> Fast Facts: Synopsys Science Fair 2017, 2018 - AI Traffic Light System

My partner and I worked on developing a <font color=#0096FF>Deep Q-Network Reinforcement Learning model</font> to control traffic lights intelligently. After interviewing the director of San Jose‚Äôs Department of Transportation, we received access to realtime data from several traffic intersections. We utilized the <font color=#0096FF>Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO)</font> and TensorFlow to create a model that demonstrated a 26% reduction in average commute time. Using an embedded processor and LED strips to represent roads, we built a prototype to visualize our findings.

**Notable Distinctions**:

* **First Place**, Physical Science and Engineering Category, Synopsys Science Fair 2019
* Invited to and honored at **San Jose City Hall**, 2020

## **Using ToF for Touchless Computer Interaction** üì∏

> Fast Facts: Synopsys Science Fair 2019, 2020 - Depth-Camera for Keyboard/Mouse

My partner and I developed a <font color=#0096FF>time-of-flight-based touchless</font> Human Interface Device (HID). Using a CamBoard Pico Flexx Time-of-flight sensor, our HID allows for mouse control and typing simply by the <font color=#0096FF>movement of one‚Äôs hand in the air</font>. The ToF camera feeds 3D distance maps to a processing pipeline comprising OpenCV and Machine Learning. This pipeline performs modelling and recognition of gestures and handwriting. This innovation will make device usage <font color=#0096FF>less restrictive and more hygienic</font> by eliminating the need for physical contact.

**Notable Distinctions**:

* Awarded **ACM Grand Prize Award**, Synopsys Science Fair 2020
* Expanded and presented as **BISV Senior Project** (in colab w/ OpenARK)
* Filed a **Utility Patent** for several innovations in HID

## **Creating singAlong Tool** üé§

> Fast Facts: Final project of *Capstone: Advanced Java + ML*, accelerated w/ TigerGraph

This program allows users to <font color=#0096FF>play any song from any timestamp simply by singing the previous verse.</font> For example, if I were to sing *‚ÄúUp above the world so high‚Äù*, the program would automatically play <font color=#0096FF>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</font> starting from the line *‚ÄúLike a diamond in the sky‚Äù*. This program is meant to be a fun game for any user and provides social company even if a user is currently by themselves. Anyone can use it to easily start playing a song from any given timestamp <font color=#0096FF>instead of just from the beginning.</font> Additionally, if a user may not remember the name of a song, they can use this program to find its name.

I later <font color=#0096FF>accelerated</font> this program using TigerGraph. Fun fact, *that's how I landed my internship!*

## **Constructing Self-Balancing Inverted Pendulum** üî®

> Fast Facts: Semester project for *Post-AP Differential Equations*, 11th grade

When asked to demonstrate an application of differential equations, I built a <font color=#0096FF>motorized cart with a freely swinging rod</font> mounted on top. Using the rod‚Äôs angular acceleration, I programmed a PID controller using the <font color=#0096FF>derived equations of motion</font> to calculate the horizontal acceleration needed to balance the rod. As a result, the cart autonomously moved back and forth to make sure the rod remained stable in the vertical position.

## **Modeling Romantic Relationships with Diff Eqs** üíï

A friend and I studied a research paper about dynamically modelling love. Using systems of first-order equations, we defined individuals‚Äô <font color=#0096FF>love as a function of their feelings, their partner's feelings, and external factors.</font> We classified lovers into four categories and analyzed all the possible combinations of individuals. By creating a phase plane plot, we were able to predict the <font color=#0096FF>duration and strength of each relationship.</font>

> *In the Desmos Plot below, a represents external factors, r represents time, and the name of each trace represents the natures of the couple. For example, C-E means Cautious and Eager while N-H means Narcissistic and Hermit. More can be found in the slides.*
