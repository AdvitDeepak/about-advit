## **FIRST Lego League** ‚öôÔ∏è

FIRST Lego League (FLL) is a competition where teams <font color=#0096FF>build and program a Lego robot to solve missions (robot game) and brainstorm a solution to each year‚Äôs themed challenge (project)</font>. For five years, I participated in FLL, learning about engineering, teamwork, and problem-solving. Our team grew and adapted to overcome challenges. We won several awards and even travelled to <font color=#0096FF>Missouri and West Virginia to participate in the internationals.</font>

Upon aging out of competition, I helped coach my brother's team. I taught engineering concepts (for example, using gravity as an extra ‚Äúmotor‚Äù), helped them learn to work together, and gave them  feedback on their research project. Additionally, my former team and I presented at <font color=#0096FF>community STEM nights</font> and advised local FLL teams with tips & tricks.

## **Personal Projects** üòÆ

Here are some of the personal creations I've made in my free time!

### **Automatic Door Closer** üîß

> Fast Facts: Gravity-powered door closing device using LEGOs and pulleys

At home, my mischievous younger brother would purposely leave my door open üôÑ. So, using <font color=#0096FF>Legos, fishing line, and a small wooden weight</font>, I defended my room by designing and installing a pulley system that would automatically close my door. The door swinging open pulled the weight up. When the handle was released, gravity pulled the weight down, thereby closing my door. It was <font color=#0096FF>inexpensive, inconspicuous, and green</font> (no electricity needed!).
