# **Exciting Education üìù**

For high school, I attended BASIS Independent Silicon Valley (BISV), located in San Jose, CA. During this time, I also took summer courses from Stanford University. Now, I'm at UCLA!

## **BISV (High School, 2017-2021)**

In total, I earned **36.85** credits and a GPA of **4.00 (UW)** and **4.86 (W)**.

??? note "BISV - Courses"

    Some of the traditionally major-related courses I've completed include:

    * **CS**: AP CS A, AP CS P, Capstone: Java + ML
    * **Math**: AP Calc AB/BC, AP Statistics, Diff Eq, Multivar Calc
    * **Physics**: AP Physics 1, AP Physics C: Mech, AP Physics C: E/M


??? success "BISV - Examinations"

    During my time at BASIS Independent Silicon Valley, I took <font color=#0096FF>19 AP courses and examinations</font> and received **4's (3 examinations total)** and **5's (16 examinations total)** by the end of my senior year.

    > *I had taken AP World History as an eighth grader as part of curricular requirements* üòÖ


    In addition, I took the following standardized tests:

    * **ACT** - 36/36
    * **SAT Math II** - 800/800
    * **SAT Biology** - 800/800
    * **SAT Chemistry** - 800/800

    In retrospect, I don't really know why I took the Bio exam. I guess I hadn't realized how squeamish I was at that point üòÖ. That epiphany came early in 9th grade, nearly fainting while watching the grafting of a human ear...


??? tip "BISV - Distinctions"

    Some of the distinctions I received during my time at BISV include:

    * **Distinguished Honor Roll** (2017 - 2021)
    * **Student of the Year**, Post-AP Diff Eqs (2020)
    * **National Merit Scholarship** Finalist (2021)

## **Stanford Summer Session(s)**

During the <font color=#0096FF>summers of junior and senior year</font>, I supplemented my coursework by taking summer courses from Stanford University. For an official transcript, kindly use [this hyperlink](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ei7gBpEc7JTsu-r3fd9O7hL6jsQPKbC8/view?usp=sharing).

In total, I earned **15** units and a GPA of **4.00 (UW)** and **4.10 (W)**.

| Course Number |                           Course Title                  | Grade | Year  |
|:-------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    MATH 51    | Linear Algebra, Multivariable Calculus, and Modern Apps |   A   | 2019  |
|    CS 106B    |         Programming Abstractions (C++, Data Structures) |   A+  | 2019  |
|     CS 103    |              Mathematical Foundations of Computing      |   A   | 2020  |

Additionally, I served as an **Office of Accessible Education (OAE) Notetaker** for CS 103, compiling
and publishing my notes for each lecture (got some sweet pocket change üòÖ).

## **UCLA Undergrad (ongoing üòÑ)**

And now, I'm here in the <font color=#0096FF>City of Angels</font>, majoring in **Computer Science**. Although I'm only a quarter of the way there, I've already learned quite a lot...


In total, I've earned **51.00** credits and a GPA of **3.98 (UW)** so far.
