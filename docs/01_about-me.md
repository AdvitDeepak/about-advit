# **Where to Start? 🧸**

<span style=font-size:1.5em;">Hi, I'm Advit! <span class="wave">👋</span> </span>

I grew up in the Bay Area, with a front-yard in San Jose and a backyard in Los Gatos 😅. Now, I'm here as a <font color=#0096FF>Computer Science and Engineering student</font> at UCLA 🐻 (class of 2025).

> *Is NorCal or SoCal better? I guess I'm still figuring that one out...*

Thanks for stopping by and checking out my dashboard!

Here's a lil collage of my adventures from this year 😁😁:

Before, we begin, here's some *tips* on <font color=#0096FF>navigating this site</font>:

* Use the **tabs** on the top, right, and left sides of the screen to click through
* Check out the **search bar** on the top to quickly look up/jump to relevant pages
* Explore the <font color=#0096FF>hyperlinked icons</font> and <font color=#0096FF>nav arrows</font> in the **black bar** (bottom of page)

## **Sweet Summary**

Let's start with my mission. Taken straight from [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/advitdeepak/),

???+ tip "Mision Statement"

    <span style=font-size:1.4em;"> *Growing up with Iron Man and Star Wars, I imagined a <font color=#0096FF>smarter future</font> — one with the <font color=#0096FF>wonders of innovations</font> like Jarvis and R2-D2. Be it programming an artificially-intelligent traffic controller, building a self-balancing inverted pendulum, or developing touchless mouse and keyboard control — since childhood, I’ve been working to <font color=#0096FF>actualize my idolized Sci-Fi future.</font>* </span>

    <span style=font-size:1.4em;"> *From flying suits to interactive holograms, we have so many applications <font color=#0096FF>requiring computational innovations</font> yet to be engineered. Making these kinds of technological leaps and working toward this Sci-Fi future are the reasons why I pursue CS.* ***It’s the most realistic form of magic I know.*** <span>

And I mean it, **every word**. Check out some of what I've been up to!

Pretty neat! In order to learn the tools for these projects, I was grateful to have access to many learning opportunities and resources. Next up, a brief educational background...
