# **Interests** ðŸ˜‹

I love a lot of different things! Here's a random dump... 

> Last modifed in early 2021... much-needed updates coming soon!  

## **Stuff I Like** ðŸ¤—

* Disney Movies (Tangled, Enchanted, Star Wars, PoTC, Marvel, etc. ðŸ¥°)

??? tip "My AP Euro Term Paper on how Beauty and the Beast inspired the French Revolution"

    Fun fact, in the original, Belle and the Prince are cousins and that's why they get married! Plus, Belle's part-fairy.
