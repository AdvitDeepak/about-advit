# **Work & Volunteering 👨‍🔧**

Here's a lil' collage capturing some of my experiences 😁😁

![Experience Banner](../assets/images/ExperienceBanner.svg)

I interned at **TigerGraph** and **UC Berkeley's OpenARK** team, volunteered for high school **student government** and the **Tech Interactive**, and
worked at **Kumon Math & Reading**.

Additionally, I'm currently interning as an **AI Projects Intern** with UCLA's ACM AI Committee.


## **ACM AI @ UCLA** 🧠

> Fast Facts: Fall '21 - Present, Creating projects and RL track

With the AI Projects team, I've been helping <font color=#0096FF>guide groups of 30+ students</font> over the span of 10 weeks as they learn and develop CNN classifiers. Additionally, I helped create a <font color=#0096FF>Casssava Leaf Disease classifier</font> using Kaggle and PyTorch. Currently, our team is curating a brand new Reinforcement Learning track centered around the game <font color=#0096FF>*Super Auto Pets*</font>.

## **TigerGraph, Inc** 🐯

> Fast Facts: Summer '21 - Winter '21', Creating demos/applications/tutorials/talks

As a Developer Advocate Intern, I was in charge of <font color=#0096FF> growing the size and richness </font> of TigerGraph’s Developer Community. I created a Movie Recommendation dashboard and several accompanying resources (tutorials, videos) to augment TigerGraph’s starter kits. To <font color=#0096FF>teach developers how to visualize graph</font> data, I developed TigerGraph’s Dash Class, a twelve-chapter tutorial website, using Python and Plotly Dash.

Additionally, I worked on organizing a <font color=#0096FF>UCLA X TigerGraph Hackathon</font>, creating a Google Flutter and Firebase sample application for climate analytics, and documenting a full-stack application course. My most recent assignment involved creating a Community Development Program to <font color=#0096FF>increase Graph engagement</font> via student clubs, local meetups, and TED talks.

As a final project, I created a Zoom meeting <font color=#0096FF>transcript analyzer</font> using Graph and NLP.

## **OpenARK Intern** 💻

> Fast Facts: Summer '20 - Summer '21, Creating touchless HID using Computer Vision

At UC Berkeley's <font color=#0096FF>Center for Augmented Cognition</font>, I interned as part of the OpenARK (Open-Source AR SDK) team. I helped expand this software kit by creating a video tutorial, debugging to smoothen the installation process, and exploring Unity gaming plugins.

As part of my high school Senior Project, I developed <font color=#0096FF>Touchless Typing using OpenARK</font>. Over the span of three months, I used an Intel D435i Camera to feed 3D distance maps into a processing pipeline. The extracted fingertip locations were then scaled to a virtual keyboard, and their <font color=#0096FF>changes in position were used to determine keypresses</font>. This project was meticulously documented with weekly blog posts and presented to hundreds.

## **BISV Leadership** 📋

> Fast Facts: **Sports Committee Head** (10th), **Vice President** (11th), **Co-President** (12th)

My high school was quite unique. It took place in a former IBM building, on a field-less campus, with a focus on academic rigor. I wanted to help <font color=#0096FF>enrich the culture </font> of our young school, which had only been around for three years. In Leadership Club, I found a group of students driven by that same motivation. Working together, we introduced new traditions including <font color=#0096FF>Wellness Week</font> to help students destress before finals, the <font color=#0096FF>Homecoming dance</font> despite not having a football team, and a <font color=#0096FF> Neurodiversity Celebration Week </font>. With each event we planned, school felt more like a fun-loving, close knit community.

For any BISV '21 alumni, here's a few memories from senior year, curated by Leadership 😄

## **Tech Interactive** 🤖

> Fast Facts: Fall '19 - Summer '21, Galleries, Buster, Special Events Volunteer

As a Galleries and Buster Volunteer, I <font color=#0096FF>operated the museum’s exhibits</font> and explained their concepts to guests. My station partner and I expanded the role of Buster— a human-sized, remote-controlled robot meant to greet visitors. We invented a personality for him, dressing him to match the holidays, telling jokes through him, and even playing hide-and-go-seek with the younger guests. This <font color=#0096FF>made the Buster experience magical</font> for both the museum visitors and ourselves. Additionally, I helped run <font color=#0096FF>introduction to robotics events</font> for Girl Scout troops, train new volunteers, and support special events such as company dinners and proms.

Additionally, I was proud to receive of the **2021 Janie & Wayne Lambert Scholarship** 😄


## **Kumon Tutoring** ✏️

> Fast Facts: Winter '19 - Summer '21, Tutoring in Math and Reading

I managed the work of <font color=#0096FF>four students per session</font>, graded their work, and provided feedback. By teaching English and math to students from kindergarten through high school, I realized that <font color=#0096FF>everyone learns differently</font>. Be it using a student’s octopus anecdote to help with sentence structure or using multicolored erasers to explain fractions, adapting to each student’s needs allowed me to <font color=#0096FF>better explain concepts and provide feedback</font>. With parents, coworkers and managers, I learned to express myself effectively yet politely.
