# **UCLA Projects** üêª 

Here are some of the projects I've done while at UCLA! 

> Projects conducted with ACM at UCLA will be added in soon!


## **Clique - Elevating Circles** üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

> Fast Facts: Web App using React, Node, Firebase, Google Maps/Calendar APIs

Clique is a web application that leverages technology to <font color=#0096FF>elevate the experience of a user‚Äôs cliques</font> (a term used to describe an exclusive circle of people, such as friend groups). This implementation allows for <font color=#0096FF>easy organization and planning of events</font> using each member of the clique‚Äôs schedule and location. The application‚Äôs features include a <font color=#0096FF>personalized profile</font>, a <font color=#0096FF>shared calendar</font> with automatic event imports, and a <font color=#0096FF>greedy algorithm to determine optimal routes</font> given each members‚Äô address, driving ability, and location destination. 

Given the difficulty in planning where and when to meet for large groups, we aimed to create a solution that would help <font color=#0096FF>automate the event-planning process</font>. Instead of wasting time on tedious discussions and debates, Clique helps <font color=#0096FF>easily determine the when, where, and how of meetups</font>. *This project was developed as part of COM SCI 35L - Software Construction Lab*

## **Messages Wrapped - NLP Summarization Dashboard** üì±

> Fast Facts: NLP Extraction, Analysis, and Summarization of Text Conversations

Let‚Äôs face it: <font color=#0096FF>we‚Äôre not all great listeners</font>. With a world of information to keep track of, we can‚Äôt expect ourselves to remember <font color=#0096FF>every birthday, address, or favorite food</font>. Yet, showing loved ones that you can remember small details about them makes them feel heard.

Messages Wrapped is here to help! Employing various <font color=#0096FF>NLP techniques, this application extracts, analyzes, and stores information directly from one's direct messages</font>. Our team created it in hopes that we would never have to send another dreaded belated birthday text or ask a close friend what their dietary restrictions were for the hundredth time.

Messages Wrapped is able to <font color=#0096FF>produce a fully-fledged statistical summary of a user‚Äôs direct messages</font>. Inspired by Spotify‚Äôs annual ‚ÄúWrapped on Spotify‚Äù, our team has included a multitude of features <font color=#0096FF>including contacts ranked by message frequency, group chat activity, average response time, word boards, and more</font>. *This project was built using Python, NLTK, Plotly, Dash and developed for LA Hacks Spring '22*.

## **Sussy Symptoms - Automated Survey Completion** ‚è≥

> Fast Facts: Android app to automate UCLA COVID-19 Survey with Selenium 

Sussy Symptoms is an application meant to enhance the experience of UCLA students and faculty by <font color=#0096FF>streamlining the completion of the daily COVID-19 Symptom Monitoring Survey</font>.

Using <font color=#0096FF>Kotlin, Java, and Selenium</font>, our team prototyped an app with the following features:

- Scheduling - choose what <font color=#0096FF>days, times</font> to complete monitoring survey
- Duo Push - uses <font color=#0096FF>SMS parsing</font> to pass Duo's Multi-Factor Authentication
- Streamline - condenses questions into <font color=#0096FF>essentials</font>: are you sick today?
- Automate - uses <font color=#0096FF>Selenium</font> to answer and complete the lengthy survey 

This solution aims to <font color=#0096FF>resolve the inconveniences that this tedious chore brings</font> to students, especially when they may be running late for breakfast, classes, or other morning events. *This project was developed using Python, NLTK, Plotly, and Dash for LA Hacks Spring '22*.
