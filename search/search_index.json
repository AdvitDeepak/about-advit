For five years, I participated in FLL, learning about engineering, teamwork, and problem-solving. Our team grew and adapted to overcome challenges. We won several awards and even travelled to Missouri and West Virginia to participate in the internationals. Upon aging out of competition, I helped coach my brother's team. I taught engineering concepts (for example, using gravity as an extra \u201cmotor\u201d), helped them learn to work together, and gave them feedback on their research project. Additionally, my former team and I presented at community STEM nights and advised local FLL teams with tips & tricks.

Automatic Door Closer \ud83d\udd27 \u00b6 Fast Facts: Gravity-powered door closing device using LEGOs and pulleys At home, my mischievous younger brother would purposely leave my door open \ud83d\ude44. So, using Legos, fishing line, and a small wooden weight , I defended my room by designing and installing a pulley system that would automatically close my door. The door swinging open pulled the weight up. When the handle was released, gravity pulled the weight down, thereby closing my door. It was inexpensive, inconspicuous, and green (no electricity needed!).
